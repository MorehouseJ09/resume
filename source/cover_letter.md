I'm a passionate software engineer, USC student and aspiring entrepreneur. I enjoy finding elegant solutions to problems through new tools and technologies. I consider myself a jack of all trades engineer who has the ability to learn new things quickly. I'm a completely self-taught engineer and have reached an elite level in just a little over a year of hacking and can't wait to continue learning.

I consider my best skills to include my Unix workflow and mastery of my basic tools and techniques. I'm a strong believer in learning new technologies and best practices and will consistently take the extra steps to do things the right way so I don't have to repeat myself. I'm a DRY/KISS developer who loves BDD/TDD using tools such as Django/Flask, Rails/Sinatra and Node/Express. I'm a full stack engineer at heart and have top-notch front-end skills, I enjoy using Less, Sass, Compass and Coffee-script where I can. I'm really excited about app development using front-end mvc frameworks such as Backbone/Angular/Ember in unison with api driven backends. Server automation and setup is another passion of mine as I enjoy using tools such as Puppet, Chef, Nginx and AWS. I'm a Unix first guy who enjoys finding new ways to use VIM, TMUX and ZSH to help my workflow. Experience and skills aside, my two most valuable traits I can bring to any team are my insane work ethic and unmatched hunger for knowledge when it comes to software development.
