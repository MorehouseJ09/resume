			%h2= "Retail Clothing Site"

			%p

				I'm currently building a commercial retail site using what I think is a really exciting technology stack. I'm working with Rails, Mongo, Yeoman, Compass, Angular and a few other libraries. My client wants to integrate with the shopify API so I'm embedded that into our backend for automated product update hooks. Front end wise, I'm using Compass with Susy, Stitch and a few other small libraries. I've decided to hack a bit on the rails framework and am trying to embed yeoman into this project instead of the asset pipeline for quicker development. Link coming soon ...

			%h2= "Prospero"

			%p

				Currently launching a full service application / website for a commerical real estate company in Canada. Implemented a complete CMS for non-technical employees to update site. Built using a LAMP backend with the CodeIgniter framework. I implemented a build tool for the project using Node.js as well as a custom search engine using C++.

			%h2= "OpenGL / WebGL HeightField Project"	

			%p 

				I created an interactive 3-d height field imaging tool using OpenGL and C++. I'm currently exploring a way to take this project onto the web using WebGL. Currently working on this using some tools such as Express.js, Three.js, Backbone.js and Mocha.js.

			%h2= "USC Medical School 3D Brain Imaging Application"

			%p

				I'm currently building a 3-d web application that transforms craniofacial MRI data into an interactive user experience. The application allows user to not only learn about facial structure, but also upload their own MRI data to compare and find deformities. The application consists of a C++ program written to extract vector data from DICOM format data as well as a javascript based front end app. I'm using WebGL with Three.js and Coffeescript to implement the interactive experience as well as an express.js app on the backend.

			%h2= "DNS / General Networking"

			%p
				I'm interested in the various networking protocols and am doing some directed research in my spare time. I'm currently hacking on a DNS Server technology called Bind to implement my own local DNS resolver.
