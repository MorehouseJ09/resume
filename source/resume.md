Overview
=

Currently a junior Computer Engineering Computer Science major at the University of Southern California. I am a professional software engineer, hacker and designer and am constantly using the newest technologies and tools to solve exiting problems. I'm currently interested in applying Natural Language Processing / Machine Learning algorithms to solving real world problems as well as web application programming. Some of my favorite tools/technologies include Javascript, GoLang, Python, Tmux and Vim.

Current Projects

Flashquest Technical Lead:
-

[Flashquest](http://flashquest.com/)

Currently developing the backend / business portal application for Flashquest. I'm in charge of making technical decisions as well as implementation of our product. I'm currently building a Ruby on Rails api to serve our data. I'm building with a Behavior Driven Development first mindset and am using technologies such as Cucumber, Rspec, MongoDB and Amazon Web Services to deliver this.

I'm also in charge of building our business portal and am primarily implementing this with Javascript / Coffeescript. I'm building an Express.js app to contact our api and deliver initial page loads to start our front-end MVC app built on BackBone.js.

Extensive Unix / MacOS Dotfiles/Script Project:
-

[Dotfiles](http://github.com/MorehouseJ09/dotfiles)

This is a current project I work on daily and that has helped my Unix skills reach an elite level. I have built out a series of configuration scripts / programs that I can apply and use on unix servers as well as my local development environment. Some features include an advanced Tmux / Vim configuration as well as generic helper scripts for solving common tasks both locally and remotely daily. I've also expanded this project to include basic boilerplate setups for both Nginx and Apache configurations and deployment as well as various scripts and tools that I have built for different languages including Python, Javascript and Ruby.

[Search Repo](http://github.com/MorehouseJ09/search_module)
[Build Tool Repo](http://github.com/MorehouseJ09/prospero_build)

This is a web application that I'm launching for a commercial real estate company out of Vancouver This is one of my first big web projects and is built on PHP using the CodeIgniter framework and a MySQL data store. I implemented a custom Content Management Solution to assist non-technical employees update the company web site. I built this project from the ground up. Along with this project I have tackled several smaller problems such as building / deploying a project, asset management, and custom database searching / indexing. 

I created an advanced build tool to help with deployment using Node.js and some front-end development apis such as lessCss and YUI. I also created a cplusplus search engine for the site, and while this isn't going to be implemented live, it was a fun way to explore c++ as a new programmer.

Directory Sync Program
-

[Sync Repo](http://github.com/morehousej09/directory_sync)

This is a project that I originally built for a course but have expanded upon since. I wanted a database driven solution for managing files on my local and remote machines so I built an advanced sync program. I'm currently rewriting the application in GoLang and am implementing pieces of the Rsync algorithm to help optimize.

OpenGL HeightField Project
-

[HeightField Repo](http://github.com/MorehouseJ09/opengl_heightfield)

My first large program with OpenGL was a height field manipulation program. I used OpenGL to analyze images and make a 3-dimensional representation of them for users to play around with. I'm working on a web based version of the project using WebGL and Coffeescript. 

Custom DNS Server
-

I'm exploring some low level inner-workings of the web as I am hacking on Bind to help build a custom DNS server for my local use. 

Work Experience
=

OpenOffer.com
-

I worked as a backend programmer implementing features and maintaining the site as we scaled. Worked primarily on the full LAMP stack and was in charge of admin, database integrity and apache configuration. Also built a small application integrating Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn with RSS PubSubHubbub protocol.

USC Institute of Multimedia Literacy
-

Currently a lab technician for this multimedia based program which is a part of the USC School of Cinematic Arts. I assist students with web basic HTML/CSS/Javascript talks. Have also given discussions and tutorials on web applications and the technologies that I work with daily.

Free Lance Software Engineering
-

I currently build web applications for various clients. Experienced with pushing production code in a timely manner as well as solving problems with latest techniques and technologies while allowing clients to stay hands off in the process.
